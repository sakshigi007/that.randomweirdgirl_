# Ask a user to enter a number
num1=int(input("enter a number:\n"))
# Ask a user to enter a second number
num2=int(input("enter another number:\n"))
# Calculate the total of the two numbers added together
print('addition')
# Print 'first number + second number = answer' 
print(num1 + num2)
# For example if someone enters 4 and 6 the output should read
# 4 + 6 = 10
